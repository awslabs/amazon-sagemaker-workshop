Elastic Inference provides GPU acceleration suited for inference, allowing you to add inference acceleration to a hosted endpoint for a fraction of the cost of using a full GPU instance.\n",

To utilize Elastic Inference with the SageMaker TensorFlow Serving container, simply provide an `accelerator_type` parameter, which determines the type of accelerator that is attached to your endpoint.

    "Although we did not demonstrate them in this notebook, Amazon SageMaker provides additional ways to make distributed training more efficient for very large datasets:\n",
    "- **VPC training**:  performing Horovod training inside a VPC improves the network latency between nodes, leading to higher performance and stability of Horovod training jobs.\n",
    "- **Pipe Mode**:  using [Pipe Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo.html#your-algorithms-training-algo-running-container-inputdataconfig) reduces startup and training times.  Pipe Mode streams training data from S3 as a Linux FIFO directly to the algorithm, without saving to disk.  To use Pipe Mode, set `input_mode='Pipe'` for the Estimator object, and enable Pipe Mode within the training script by importing PipeModeDataset from the SageMaker Python SDK and setting `dataset = PipeModeDataset(channel=channel_name, record_format='TFRecord')` (see the train.py script for this example).  For a small dataset such as CIFAR-10, Pipe Mode does not provide any advantage, but for very large datasets Pipe Mode can substantially reduce startup and training times."
